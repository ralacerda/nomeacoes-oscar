# Sequela Movie App (WIP)

[![Built with Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v1/built-with-astro.svg)](https://astro.build)

## Introduction

This is the repository for the [Sequela Movie App](https://sequelamovies.web.app/).

The goal of the app is to provide a summary of recent [Oscars](https://www.oscars.org/), including nominated movies, winner and their relevant information.

## Tools

Right now the front-end is developed using [Astro](astro.build/), with plains to implement a Database and Authentication using [Firebase](firebase.google.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

The data to build this website is collected using a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) script that crosses data from
[The Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and the [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) dataset hosted locally on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The script might be published later.
